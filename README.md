# This Project is Restaurant app build using JavaScript to render the page. It is a simple weather app which displays the weather details of places.


> In this project, i built a `Weather` app following the [OdinProject](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/weather-app) specification.<br>


## Project Description

The project is initialized by running `npm install webpack webpack-cli --save-dev` to install webpack to the node_modules directory of your project.
A `src and dist` is created in the directory with the following contents:
- index.js file in src.
- index.html file in dist. 
- main.js is by generated by webpack when you run `npm run build`.
- A `webpack.common.js` is created to do the basic configurations.
- An HTML skeleton inside of `dist/index.html` file.

Bare-bones html is created for the application. Javascript is used to manipulate the DOM.
functions that hit the API are created. The functions take a location and return the weather data for that location..

Next, is the functions that process the JSON data we‚Äôre getting from the API and return an object with only the data  required for your app.

A simple form that will let users input their location and will fetch the weather info is created and dispaly the information on the webpage!.
A ‚Äòloading‚Äô component that displays from the time the form is submitted until the information comes back from the API is created.
